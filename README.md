## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights  

* **Total revenue showed a clear upward trend**, reflecting steady business growth.  
* **YoY movements** revealed seasonality in sales and shifts in top-performing product categories.  
* **Paid Search and Organic Search** were the dominant channels for customer acquisition.  
* **Returning customers were very few** compared to new customers, suggesting strong acquisition but weak retention. Addressing this gap could unlock significant revenue potential.
